        <p>The MeetingPlanner (MP) Configuration Guide includes UI setting information for both the Add-in and Web Scheduler applications. All settings are accessed via the Web Scheduler: http://yourserver/suite. Use the  icon and dropdown menu from the top right corner of the Web Scheduler homepage calendar to access the settings and customize the MP environment to fit the needs of your organization.</p>
        <p>Upon installation, MP defaults to the settings most commonly used. We recommend that you begin with the basic default settings and enable additional settings, if deemed necessary, as you become more familiar with the software.</p>
        <p class="box-note"><span class="bold">Note: </span>Administration users with access (security permission) will be able to change the MP settings and make configuration changes ONLY. End users will not have configuration setting permissions. Although, if given access, end users can make a few changes to their desktop ONLY using the preferences setting in the Add-in application. Please see the Add-in User Guide for instruction on preference settings.</p>
        <h2>Application Cache Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>Some configuration changes in the Add-in require a user to “clear the cache” in order for setting changes to take immediate effect. Please see Clear MeetingPlanner Cache. The Web Scheduler setting changes are immediate and require no caching.</p>
