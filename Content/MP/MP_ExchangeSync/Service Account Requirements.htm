        <h1 class="Heading1" MadCap:autonum="CHAPTER&#160;1: ">Service Account Requirements &amp; Uses</h1>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Required Permissions</h2>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Exchange</h3>
        <p>The account will require a mailbox on the Exchange server and permissions for the resources and user accounts that the Exchange Sync service will be acting upon. &#160;</p>
        <p>There are two different privileges that can be granted to the service account for each mailbox that needs to be managed by Exchange Sync:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><span class="bold">Calendar Permission</span>: Granting "Editor" level delegate permissions will be sufficient to&#160;allowing the Exchange Sync service to create and modify meetings only; the service will not be able to delete meetings from the calendar. &#160;In a standard Exchange 2010 environment, this would be accomplished by running the following command in the Exchange Management Shell.<ol><li>Add-MailboxFolderPermission—Identity UserOrRoom:\Calendar -User ServiceAcct&#160;-AccessRights ReadItems,EditAllItems,DeleteAllItems</li></ol></li>
            <li>Deleted Items Permission: &#160;Granting "Contributor" permissions to the 'Deleted Items' folder&#160;will allow the Exchange Sync service to create, modify, and delete meetings; without these permissions, the service will only be able to create and modify meetings on the calendar. &#160;In a standard Exchange 2010 environment, this would be accomplished by running the following command in the Exchange Management Shell.<ol><li>Add-MailboxFolderPermission—Identity UserOrRoom:"\Deleted Items" -User ServiceAcct&#160;-AccessRights CreateItems</li></ol></li>
        </ol>
        <p class="box-note"><span class="bold">NOTE</span>: "Moves" and "deletes" do not automatically send out notifications to invited users; these will need to be done manually by the user.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Application Server</h3>
        <p>The account will also require Local Administrator access on the application server, and "Log on as a batch job" permissions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">Local Administrator</span> (Start &gt; Administrative Tools &gt; Computer Management)</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Log on as a batch job</span> (Start &gt; Administrative Tools &gt; Local Security Settings)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Additional Requirements</h2>
        <p>The account will need to access the Exchange server from the application server, so there cannot be a Group Policy, Firewall, or Proxy that will prevent this from happening.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Account Uses</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>MeetingPlanner Exchange Sync service Log On account (Start &gt; Administrative Tools &gt; Services).</li>
            <li>Will be entered in the MeetingPlanner Configuration Tool on the application server ("Exchange Sync" tab).</li>
            <li>Will be entered into the MeetingPlanner Web &gt; Setup &gt; General Settings &gt; Room page as well. &#160;This will be the account used to create tasks, which will be used to send meeting conflict notifications.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Security</h3>
        <p>Once entered into MeetingPlanner, the service account name and password will be encrypted and stored in two configuration files located on the MeetingPlanner application server.</p>
