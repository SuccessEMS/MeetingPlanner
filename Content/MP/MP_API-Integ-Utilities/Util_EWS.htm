        <h2 class="Heading2">Background</h2>
        <p>Emergingsoft has multiple products that integrate with Exchange, many of which utilize Exchange Web Services. &#160;This diagnostics tool can help identify URL, service account password, and permissions issues. &#160;As a first troubleshooting step, Emergingsoft has put this tool together to help with troubleshooting.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Installation</h2>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>Download the zip file to any machine on your network.</li>
            <li>Make sure that the zip is "Unblocked" once it is on the server.</li>
            <li>Extract the files.</li>
            <li>Double-click the "Emergingsoft.MeetingPlanner.ExchangeDiagnosticsTool.exe" to run the application.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Functionality &amp; Use</h2>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>Launching the tool will bring up the diagnostics interface. &#160;</li>
            <li>Input the appropriate settings as they are in MeetingPlanner.</li>
            <li>Click "Run." &#160;(Note: The tool may take several minutes to return a result, please be patient)</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>Credential Validation: &#160;The first section of the diagnosis will contain credential validation. &#160;This is to establish that the service account has access, as well as which form of the credentials are required by the Exchange server.</li>
            <li>Contact Email Address(es) Check: &#160;This confirms that the service account has an active mailbox in Exchange (a requirement for Emergingsoft's EWS integration).</li>
            <li>Impersonation Check: &#160;This confirms if the service account can impersonate the provided email address. &#160;If no "Impersonation Email" is provided, this diagnostics section will not return.</li>
            <li>Room Permissions: Delegate Check: &#160;This provides the users that have explicit delegate privileges. &#160; Any accounts with "Full Access," will not be listed here.</li>
        </ul>
