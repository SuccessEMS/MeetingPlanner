        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Many ASP.NET products have a long compilation time, which leads to a long loading time for the first user to access the website after an application pool is recycled. &#160;Emergingsoft's products are no exception, and also do quite a bit of application caching at this time. &#160;While this ultimately leads to a faster website, it can be a burden on that initial user. &#160;</p>
        <p>In order to alleviate the issue, Emergingsoft has put together an IIS warmup application that can be run to simulate the first user. &#160;Once setup, the first user of the day will no longer experience this initial delay.</p>
        <h2>Installation &amp; Configuration</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Download the zip file provided. First confirm that the Zip is not blocked by Windows. &#160;This can be done by right-clicking on the file, going to Properties and clicking "Unblock." &#160;If the "Unblock" button is not present, then the archive is already unblocked.</li>
            <li>Extract the files into a new folder on the application server (typically: &#160;...\Emergingsoft\IisWarmup).</li>
            <li>Open the configuration file and update the &lt;WarmUpElement&gt; URLs. &#160;(Note: If you wish to add any additional websites to the application, please feel free to do so).</li>
            <li>Save and close.</li>
            <li>Open the Administrative Tools &gt; Task Scheduler.</li>
            <li>Create a new task. &#160;Necessary task configurations are listed below:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 72pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;">General &gt;&#160;"Run as...":&#160;&#160;This account will need to be an domain account with a MeetingPlanner user profile.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;">General &gt;&#160;"Run whether user is logged on or not":&#160;&#160;Enable</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;">Triggers &gt;&#160;Daily at 1:00am:&#160;&#160;By default the Web Scheduler will recycle everyday at midnight. &#160;If this changes, you will want to modify the trigger or add additional entries. &#160;This should be run after every recycle.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;">Actions&#160;&gt;&#160;Start a program:&#160;This should point to the .exe file that was part of the downloaded package.</li>
