        <h1 MadCap:autonum="CHAPTER&#160;1: ">Resource Isolation:&#160;Splitting Application Pools</h1>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>The RoomWizard Connector is setup as a web application, side-by-side with the MeetingPlanner and MeetingPlanner_WS applications.  All of these applications, by default, share an application pool.  If issues are encountered or a better allocation of resources on the application server is required or desired, the RoomWizard Connector can be split into its own application pool.  This will allow the MeetingPlanner users and RoomWizard Connector to maintain separate connection pools and memory allocations.</p>
        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Open IIS.</li>
            <li>Create a new application pool.  this new application pool will be the RoomWizard App Pool and should mirror the MeetingPlanner App Pool setup.</li>
            <li>Once the RoomWizard App Pool is created, select the Default Web Site &gt; RoomWizard application.</li>
            <li> Click "Advanced Settings" and update the Application Pool from MeetingPlannerAppPool to the RoomWizard pool that was just created.</li>
            <li> After completion, it may also be beneficial to reset IIS.</li>
        </ol>
