        <p class="NormalWeb_1">There are two ways for third-parties to interact with Exchange: MAPI and Exchange Web Services (EWS).&#160; This document will cover the latter, which is the primary avenue for MeetingPlanner to interact with Exchange from the application server.&#160;</p>
        <p class="NormalWeb_1">While developers are given the ability to interact directly with EWS, MeetingPlanner uses Microsoft’s own EWS Managed API, which is Microsoft’s recommended interface for interacting with EWS.&#160;</p>
