        <h1 class="Heading1">Uninstalling a Self-Packaged Version (v1.6.0.0 - v1.8.2.0)</h1>
        <h2 class="Heading2_1">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="NormalWeb_1">Web Scheduler v1.8.2.0 and previous were packaged within their own msi, with additional services requiring a manual installation of each. As of MeetingPlanner Family build v5.5.3.8, the Web Scheduler and its services have been packaged together with MeetingPlanner.&#160;Due to the change in installation process, you will need to uninstall your current version using the steps below and then move forward with the new installation.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2_1">Procedure</h2>
        <h3 class="Heading3_1">Web Scheduler</h3>
        <p class="NormalWeb"><span class="span_1">1) &#160;Open the </span><span class="Emphasis_1">Control Panel &gt; </span><span class="Strong_1">Add/Remove Programs</span><span class="span_1">.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="NormalWeb_1">2) &#160;Select "MeetingPlanner Web Scheduler."</p>
        <p class="NormalWeb_1">3) &#160;Click "Uninstall."</p>
        <p class="NormalWeb_1">If you are installing a newer version on this server, please proceed through the following steps:</p>
        <p class="NormalWeb_1">4) &#160;Go to the C:\Program Files (x86)\Emergingsoft\Scheduler directory.</p>
        <p class="NormalWeb_1">5) &#160;Open the web.config and note the "MeetingPlanner Url." &#160;(This will be needed for the installation process)</p>
        <p class="NormalWeb_1">6) &#160;Delete the web.config. While this file is typically retained between versions, there is an important update that you will need when installing a newer version, so you will want to delete the existing file. Once your new installation is complete, simply update the "MeetingPlanner Url" setting.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3_1">Appointment Notifier Service</h3>
        <p class="NormalWeb_1">If you will not be installing a newer version of the Web Scheduler, please skip to step 3.</p>
        <p class="NormalWeb_1">1) &#160;Open the Services panel.</p>
        <p class="NormalWeb_1">2) &#160;Note the "Log On" account for the "Emergingsoft Appointment Notifier" service. &#160;This will need to be reset after the installation of the newer version of the Web Scheduler.</p>
        <p class="NormalWeb_1">3) &#160;Open the cmd.exe as an Administrator.</p>
        <p class="NormalWeb_1">4) &#160;User the "cd" command to navigate to the .NET 4.0 directory</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
