        <h1 class="Heading1" MadCap:autonum="CHAPTER&#160;1: ">Uninstalling a Self-Packaged Version (v1.6.0.0 - v1.8.2.0)</h1>
        <h2 class="Heading2_1">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="NormalWeb_1">Web Scheduler v1.8.2.0 and previous were packaged within their own msi, with additional services requiring a manual installation of each. As of MeetingPlanner Family build v5.5.3.8, the Web Scheduler and its services have been packaged together with MeetingPlanner.&#160;Due to the change in installation process, you will need to uninstall your current version using the steps below and then move forward with the new installation.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2_1">Procedure</h2>
        <h3 class="Heading3_1">Web Scheduler</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><span class="span_1">Open the </span><span class="Emphasis_1">Control Panel &gt; </span><span class="Strong_1">Add/Remove Programs</span><span class="span_1">.</span>
            </li>
            <li>Select "MeetingPlanner Web Scheduler."</li>
            <li>Click "Uninstall."</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you are installing a newer version on this server, please proceed through the following steps:</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Go to the C:\Program Files (x86)\Emergingsoft\Scheduler directory.</li>
            <li>Open the web.config and note the "MeetingPlanner Url." &#160;(This will be needed for the installation process)</li>
            <li>Delete the web.config. While this file is typically retained between versions, there is an important update that you will need when installing a newer version, so you will want to delete the existing file. Once your new installation is complete, simply update the "MeetingPlanner Url" setting.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 class="Heading3_1">Appointment Notifier Service</h3>
        <p class="NormalWeb_1">If you will not be installing a newer version of the Web Scheduler, please skip to step 3.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the Services panel.</li>
            <li>Note the "Log On" account for the "Emergingsoft Appointment Notifier" service. &#160;This will need to be reset after the installation of the newer version of the Web Scheduler.</li>
            <li>Open the cmd.exe as an Administrator.</li>
            <li>Use the "cd" command to navigate to the .NET 4.0 directory.</li>
        </ol>
