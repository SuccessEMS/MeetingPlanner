        <p class="NormalWeb"><span class="span_1">As was mentioned earlier, MeetingPlanner utilizes the Microsoft Managed API library.</span><span class="span_4">[4]</span><span class="span_1">&#160; The library is responsible for sending information down the wire and receiving the response.&#160; This allows all information to be sent securely, via Microsoft’s own best practices.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="NormalWeb_1">Based on the standard setup, which requires an https EWS url, all communications occur via an SSL.&#160; MeetingPlanner will also validate the SSL certificate prior to creating a connection.&#160; (As may be required in certain test environments, there is an option to disable this SSL check:&#160; Suite &gt; Menu &gt; Integrations &gt; EWS &gt; Ignore SSL Errors).</p>
