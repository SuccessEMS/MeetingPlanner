        </ol>
        <p>Note:&#160;Once a delegate reservation is reserved and closed, the ‘Reservation Manager’ window will prompt the user to Send or Close (not send) an email notification to the Delegate of the reservation.

            <li>Select&#160;&#160;next to the desired setup type.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note:&#160; Organizations may identify setup reservation cut-off hours before a meeting. Users will not be able to reserve meetings with setup within the set cut-off time (unless “No Preference” setup is chosen).</p>
        <p>Note:&#160;Web Scheduler automatically generates a notification to support the setup crew indicating the meeting room, time, date, and setup request.&#160;</p>

            <li>Select&#160;the desired portable equipment to add to the room.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Note: &#160;Web Scheduler automatically generates a notification to the equipment support crew indicating the meeting room, time, date, and portable equipment reservation. Emails are not sent to equipment support crews when rooms that house fixed equipment are reserved since this equipment is ALWAYS in the room; no support is needed..&#160; </p>
