        <h3 class="Heading3">Restricted Room Request Template</h3>
        <p>The template is used to create the email sent to all room owner administrators when a “normal” end user requests a restricted room reservation.</p>

        </ol>
        <p>The administrator of the restricted room will also receive the room request. In order to carryout this feature in MP, owners are named administrators of the restricted group. See Assigning an Administrator of the Restricted Room Group. Once they receive restricted room requests, they are required to either approve or deny the restricted room reservation. At which time, the requester will be notified.</p>
