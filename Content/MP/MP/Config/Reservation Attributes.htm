        <p>The request form will allow a user, with restricted MP access, to request a resource reservation. An administrator will be assigned to accept or deny such requests. It is up to the organization to inform the requestor of the status of their requested reservation.</p>
        <p>A user profile and group to include the ‘create request’ application item (security permission) will need to be created. Users who utilize the request form will need to be associated with the group. </p>
        <p>Customize and enable the request form fields to collect the necessary information from the requester.</p>
