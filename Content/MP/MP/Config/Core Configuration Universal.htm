        <h1 class="Heading1">Core Configuration - Universal Schedules (Room Groups)</h1>
        <p>(Application&gt;Core Configuration&gt;Universal Schedules)</p>
        <p>Universal Schedules are identified rooms that are grouped together and displayed from the calendar for users to reserve from. The purpose of Universal Schedules is so that groups of rooms can be handpicked to fit the needs of schedulers (ie. a universal schedule may be created to consist of rooms located in the west wing of a building. A second schedule may be created and consist of rooms located on the east wing). This is a way to simplify scheduling and narrow down room searches for users.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Note: Universal Schedules will be made available to all users accessing the Web Scheduler and Add in. Users will also be able to create their own “Room Groups” from their desktop (as described in the Web Scheduler User Guide). Room Groups created from a desktop are available to individual users ONLY.</p>
