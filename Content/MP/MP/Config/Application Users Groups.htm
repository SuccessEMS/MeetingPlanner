        <p>Upon installation, all users are granted basic reservation rights by default when MP is installed. This means that all normal users have access to the Outlook Add-in but not the Web Scheduler. If there are users that need access to the Web Scheduler calendar, configuration/setup menu, reports, ect, additional user groups must be created to include application items (security permissions) to permit such access.</p>
