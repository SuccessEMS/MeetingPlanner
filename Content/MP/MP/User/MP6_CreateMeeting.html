        <h3>Room Search Parameters</h3>
        <p>MeetingPlanner allows users to search for rooms according to Hierarchy, Number of Attendees, In-Room Equipment (fixed equipment), and Work Requests (room setup, ie: videoconferencing).</p>
        <p class="box-note"><span class="bold">Note:</span> At a glance, the green bar (in each room window) is a visual indicator of the amount of attributes available in response to the data entered in the search parameters.&#160; </p>
        <h3>Select Hierarchy Location from ‘Search’ Window</h3>
        <ol class="number-list">
            <li>Enable &#160;the desired hierarchy location from the ‘Search’ window.<p>Click on the arrows, next to each location, to narrow the search and view the hierarchy tree.&#160; </p></li>
