            <h2>Introduction</h2> <p>Meeting Planner simplifies room and resource scheduling with its interactive interface. It is used in conjunction with Microsoft Outlook/Exchange as a stand-alone application and with Meeting Planner Web Scheduler. It allows users to reserve rooms, catering, equipment, setup, videoconferencing and more. Notifications for reservation requests are automatically generated to facility support crews, and meetings synch to Microsoft Outlook and all other Meeting Planner applications (i.e., Web Scheduler, Floor Planner, Room Signs and Software).</p><h2><strong>Create Meeting in Microsoft Outlook </strong></h2></div>
        <p>Create a meeting from the Outlook Calendar to include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Meeting date/time</li>
            <li>Subject</li>
            <li>Attendees</li>
            <li>A recurring pattern</li>
            <li>Notes</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong>Access and View </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>Open Meeting Planner by launching the <strong>New Reservation</strong> tool from the Outlook calendar. </p>
